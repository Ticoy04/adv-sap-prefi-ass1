## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
3. Define Microservices.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

ANSWER

1.	Service-oriented architecture is software development that uses software components to create a business application. The benefits of using SOA are (1) that it can save time because it will not start from scratch. (2) It has efficient maintenance because it's easier to create, update, and debug small services, and it can modify any service, but it doesn't have an impact on the overall performance of the system. (3) Last but not least, it has greater adaptability because SAO is adaptable in the current technology.

2.	The SAO has an 8 characteristic. Standardize service contract, Loose coupling, Abstraction, Reusability, Autonomy, Statelessness, Discoverability, and Composability. (1) Standardize service contract make the consumer use the service easier. (2) SOA offers agility by facilitating loose-coupling between clients and support providers, breaking dependency by placing a service between the two. (3) Abstraction can describe technology in the context of a business process. (4) Reusability it creates a flywheel effect for innovation. (5) Autonomy the users can consume the service in a secure way in any compatible front end. (6) Statelessness this service deals with a moment in time and it has no memory. (7) Discoverability this service encourage reuse by providing easy to use search and documentation. (8) lastly the Composability this allow the customers to discover a business capability to create more complex business processes.

3.	Microservices is an architectural style that enables an organization to deliver a large, complex applications rapidly and sustainably.

4.	The benefits of Microservices is it can improved scalability because it increases in user traffic affect all aspects of the application. It has a better fault isolation for more resilient applications it allow the developers to prevent cascading failures. Another benefits of microservices is the programming language and technology agnostic the developers can connect microservices program in any language. Next  one is it has a better data security and compliance since each service is responsible for a specific task it can implement security at the service level easier. And microservices has a Greater business agility and support for DevOps because microservices supports the rapid delivery of software by allowing developers to work ok small, independent pieces of an application.

5.	The similarities of SAO and microservices is they are both use for business because it helps to save more time and effort if they are using SAO and microservices. The only difference of both architecture is the SAO is a software development and the microservices is use to delivery a large, complex applications rapidly and sustainably.
